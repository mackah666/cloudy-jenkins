Add files to this directory to specify additional patterns of paths to be
included in the cloud Jenkins backup files.

Blank lines, and lines starting with the # character, are ignored.

Other lines should start with a / character, and are converted into a -regex
argument for the "find" command by replacing the first / with ^/var/lib/jenkins
and adding a $ to the end.

For example:

/[^/]+\.xml
/jobs/[^/]+/config\.xml

becomes part of a command similar to:

find /var/lib/jenkins \
  -regex '^/var/lib/jenkins/[^/]+\.xml$' \
  -o \
  -regex '^/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/[^/]+/config\.xml$'

which would list all of the xml files directly under /var/lib/jenkins and all
of the config.xml files in the job directories.

Be aware that the contents of any listed directories are not automatically
included, so /jobs/[^/]+ will list all of the job directories but not anything
under them.  That particular pattern could be changed to /jobs/.+ to pull in
the job directories _and_ everything below them, but this leads to very large
backups containing copies of build workspaces and artifacts.
